# Remote-Control-Tripod


### Description
  This project is a tripod with the capability of turning on all axes to aim a phone camera attached. It is controlled by an IR Universal Remote and an Arduino Uno.
### Design
  
### Research
**Arm Types**
- Articulate Arm
  - Could aim the phone in any direction and could have depth
  - Fairly easy to design and build
- Polar Arm
  - Simpler and much easier to design and build
  - Less depth
**Phone Holder**
**IR Remotes**
- GE Universal Remote [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Lighting-Device-Universal-Remote/dp/B076QDZZF9?ref_=ast_sto_dp)
- 30ft range

### Materials
- Arduino Uno w/ prototyping shield
- IR Remote and IR Reciever
- 3x 180 Servo
- 
### Goals

### Proof of Concept
