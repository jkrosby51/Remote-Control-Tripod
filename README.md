# Remote-Control-Tripod

### Description
  This project is a portable self controlled tripod to be used for taking quality and well aimed pictures on your own from up to 30ft away from the camera. It is capable of turning on all axes to aim a phone camera mounted at the top. It is controlled by an IR Universal Remote and an Arduino Uno.
  
### Goals *** explain why ***
  The goal of this project is to create an IR remote controlled tripod with 180 degree rotation in all directions.

### Criteria 
- 180 degree rotation of x, y, and z axes
- Remote controlled easily from a potentially large distance
- Has universal phone mount
- Tri-pod itself has a 1/4" female thread on the bottom

### Constraints
- Lack of knowledge on IR remotes
- Missing research on different arm types
- Small budget; Must create most/all ourselves
- Missing design for phone mount
- Must be finished before Feb 14, 2022

### Research
**Arm Types**
- Articulate Arm
  - Could aim the phone in any direction and could have depth
  - Fairly easy to design and build
- Polar Arm
  - Simpler and much easier to design and build
  - Less depth

**IR Remotes**
- GE Universal Remote [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Lighting-Device-Universal-Remote/dp/B076QDZZF9?ref_=ast_sto_dp)
  - 30ft range

### Design
- First Design  
  - Articulate Arm
  - Allowed for large range in the position of the camera
- Second Design
  - Polar Arm
  - Allowed for full range in rotation and camera aim
  - Removed the ability for depth and range for camera position
  - Much simpler design

### Materials
- Arduino Uno w/ prototyping shield
- IR Remote and IR Reciever
- 3x 180 Servo

### Proof of Concept
Controlling LEDs with IR Remote & Reciever
