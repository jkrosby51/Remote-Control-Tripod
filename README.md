# Remote-Control-Tripod


### Description
  This project is a tripod with the capability of turning on all axes to aim a phone camera attached from up to 30ft away. It is controlled by an IR Universal Remote and an Arduino Uno.
### Design
- First Design  
  - Articulate Arm
  - Allowed for large range in the position of the camera
- Second Design
  - Polar Arm
  - Allowed for full range in rotation and camera aim
  - Removed the ability for depth and range for camera position
  - Much simpler design
### Research
**Arm Types**
- Articulate Arm
  - Could aim the phone in any direction and could have depth
  - Fairly easy to design and build
- Polar Arm
  - Simpler and much easier to design and build
  - Less depth

**Phone Holder**

**IR Remotes**
  - GE Universal Remote [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Lighting-Device-Universal-Remote/dp/B076QDZZF9?ref_=ast_sto_dp)
  - 30ft range

### Materials
- Arduino Uno w/ prototyping shield
- IR Remote and IR Reciever
- 3x 180 Servo

### Goals

### Proof of Concept
Controlling LEDs with IR Remote & Reciever
